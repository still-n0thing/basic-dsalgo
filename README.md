### Implemented :
1. Basic Sorting
    - [x] Insertion Sort ```O(n^2)```
    - [x] Merge Sort with Merge method ```O(nlog(n))```
2. Heaps and Sorting 
    - [x] Insert into heap ```O(log(n))``` 
    - [x] Delete minimum element from heap ```O(log(n))```
    - [x] Shift up and Shift down for Binary Tree ```O(log(n))```
    - [x] Normal and memory efficient Heap Sort ```O(nlog(n))```
3. Quick Sort and Order Statistics
    - [x] Quick Sort ```O(nlog(n))```
    - [x] Order Statistics ```O(n)```
4. Radix and Counting Sort
    - [x] Radix Sort ```O(d*(n+b))```
    - [x] Counting Sort ```O(n+k)```
5. Binary Search and its application for sorted array
    - [x] Binary Search ```O(log(n))```
    - [x] minimun i such that a[i] >= x ```O(log(n))```
    - [x] maximum i such that a[i] <= x ```O(log(n))```
6. Stack and Queue using arrays and dynamic memory allocation
    - [x] Stack push ```O(n) or amortized O(1)```
    - [x] Stack pop ```O(n) or amortized O(1)```
    - [x] Queue add ```O(n) or amortized O(1)```
    - [x] Queue remove ```O(n) or amortized O(1)```
6. Linked lists, Stack and Queue
    - [x] Single Linked List append ```O(n)```
    - [x] Single Linked List remove ```O(n)```
    - [x] Doubly Linked List append ```O(n)```
    - [x] Doubly Linked List remove ```O(n)```
    - [x] Stack push ```O(1)```
    - [x] Stack pop ```O(1)```
    - [x] Queue add ```O(1)```
    - [x] Queue remove ```O(1)```
