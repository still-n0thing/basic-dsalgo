# basic-dsalgo

### Implemented :
1. Basic Sorting
    - [x] Insertion Sort ```O(n^2)```
    - [x] Merge Sort with Merge method ```O(nlog(n))```
2. Heaps and Sorting 
    - [x] Insert into heap ```O(log(n))``` 
    - [x] Delete minimum element from heap ```O(log(n))```
    - [x] Shift up and Shift down for Binary Tree ```O(lon(n))```
    - [x] Normal and memory efficient Heap Sort ```O(nlog(n))```
